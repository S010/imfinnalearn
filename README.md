<h2>Info</h2>
ImFinnaLearn is a libary software by Jacob Morgan , Charlie Grimshaw and Jack Crawshaw. As a school project we have been tasked with creating a libary software for a fictional university, since the current software in the university is slow and unresponsive.
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
The software that currently is used at Doncaster university is too slow and unresponsive , it is creating huge problems such as queues and inconvenient holdups for all the students in the university.
Multiple people have reported slow wait times when waiting for a new order from the library and an unresponsive scanner that takes a long time to connect with the school's library database. 
Also as more items are scanned the software becomes overloaded with commands making it slower as more items are scanned, so as time goes on the system will get worse. 
A new piece of software needs to be created to replace the current system.
<h2>Questionnaire</h2>
As a class we needed to ask the others what they wanted , so we made a questionnaire. Here are the results:

The results of the Questionnaire show that people believe the current system is very bad due to many reasons, such as it being too slow, it being too hard to use and the lack of the online system being there. The most voted rating for speed is 2 out of 5 showing us that we need to increase the speed of the system as it is a large problem. 

Most people vote in the lower half when it comes to how easy it is to use our library meaning we need to make it a lot easier to access and use for people of all backgrounds. 

Also there are a lot of people who use the Library for many hours a week meaning it is urgent that we make the library better and quicker to use with less queueing.
